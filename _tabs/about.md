## 🛡️ About Me

Cyber threats evolve and so do I. As a Cybersecurity Engineer and Ethical Hacker, I specialize in fortifying digital landscapes, identifying vulnerabilities before the adversaries, and crafting resilient security architectures. My expertise spans penetration testing, threat analysis, and security automation, ensuring organizations stay ahead of cyber risks.

With a hacker mindset and a defender’s strategy, I thrive in offensive security, red teaming, and incident response. Whether it’s breaking into systems (legally!) to expose weaknesses or engineering robust defenses, I’m passionate about securing the digital world.

And here's the thing: there's always a catch. Always an angle. I don't just poke around — I dig until the layers unravel and the truth spills out. Security isn't just about defense; it's about understanding the game behind the game.

This site is a glimpse into my world: the tools I build, the problems I solve, and the chaos I occasionally embrace.  
**Welcome to the edge of security.**
