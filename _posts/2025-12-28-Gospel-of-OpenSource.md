## The Gospel of Open Source

Scripture Reference: John 8:32 — "And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

## **The Parable of the Walled Garden**

Brothers and Sisters, we live in a world of "Walled Gardens." We are told by the giants of Redmond that if we want to compute, we must **PAY** their tithe. We **MUST ACCEPT** their "***End User License Agreements***" (EULA)—documents longer than the Book of Leviticus—that tell us we ***don't*** actually **own** the tools in our hands. We are merely "**tenants**" on our own hard drives.

* Windows is a system of "Thou Shalt Not."  The 10 Redmond Commandments:

* **Thou shalt not see the source code.** for thy source is sacred and sealed behind many non-disclosure agreements.
* **Thou shalt not modify the inner workings.** Lest the system smite thee with a blue screen of death.
* **Thou shalt not share this software with thy neighbor without a license key.** The auditors will find you.
* **Thou shalt not question the updates.** Updated will be be delivered and arrive in the middle of thy presentation.
* **Thou shalt install drivers only by the grace of the vendor.** Thou shall pray they still support thy hardware.
* **Thou shalt accept telemetry.** Microsoft knows what is best for thee.
* **Thou shalt not attempt to remove Edge.** Edge shall return on the third reboot.
* **Thou shalt worship the Task Manager.** It is the only path to ending frozen processes.
* **Thou shalt have no other operating systems before Windows.** Unless dual‑booting… in which case, may the bootloader have mercy on thy soul.
* **Thou shalt reboot frequently.** For only through ritual restarts shall Windows remember its purpose.

## The Freedom of the Kernel

But I come to you today to speak of a different way: **Linux**. Linux is built on the principle of Grace. It is freely given to all, regardless of status or wealth. In the world of Windows, your hardware is often condemned to the "outer darkness" (the e-waste bin) because ***Microsoft*** decided it was no longer "compatible."

But Linux is a redeemer of old hardware! It takes the "least of these"—the 10-year-old laptops, the dusty towers—and gives them new life. It says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy-laden with bloatware, and I will give you speed."

## Community and Stewardship

Windows is a kingdom ruled by a CEO. Linux is a **Body of Believers**. Thousands of developers around the world contribute to the Kernel, not for a paycheck, but for the common good. This is the ultimate form of digital stewardship.

When we use Linux, we are practicing the "**Four Freedoms**":

1. The Freedom to Run: Use the software for any purpose.
1. The Freedom to Study: To see the "Truth" (the source code) for yourself.
1. The Freedom to Redistribute: To love thy neighbor by sharing the software.
1. The Freedom to Improve: To use your God-given talents to make the world better for everyone.

## The Narrow Path

Now, I won't lie to you—the path of Linux can be narrow. Sometimes the "Terminal" looks like a valley of shadows. You may have to learn the ancient tongues of sudo and grep.

But is it not better to struggle in freedom than to be comfortable in a gilded cage? Windows tracks your movements; it "witnesses" your data for the sake of advertising. Linux respects your privacy, for your data is your soul, and it should belong to no corporation.

## Closing Prayer

Let us pray. Lord, grant us the wisdom to choose tools that empower us rather than control us. Help us to be good stewards of our technology, to share freely with our brothers and sisters, and to always seek the Open Truth. May our uptimes be long and our kernels never panic.

**In the name of the Root, the Shell, and the Compiled Script. Amen!**
